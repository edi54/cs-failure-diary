## 🧠 Algorithm Mistake Log  
`knowledge++; // still wrong`

A minimal archive of my algorithm mistakes, wrong approaches, and the reasoning behind the correct solutions.  
This repo exists to help future-me avoid repeating the same DP/state mistakes over and over.
<br/>

## 📌 Purpose
- Document **why** a solution attempt failed  
- Capture incorrect assumptions, missing states, and flawed transitions  
- Summarize the **correct intuition** without rewriting full solutions  
- Provide a searchable reference of personal weak patterns (DP, greedy, graphs, etc.)
<br/>

## 📚 Structure
Each problem has its own markdown file:
```
cs-failure-diary/
├── README.md
├── BOJ/
│   └── problem_name.md
├── LC/
│   └── problem_name.md
├── PGS/
│   └── problem_name.md
└── ...

```

Inside each note:
- What I tried  
- Why it failed  
- Core insight to fix it
<br/>

## 📝 Commit Convention
```
docs(boj####): add wrong-approach notes
docs: refine explanation for missing state
docs(boj####): summarize correct intuition
```

Short, clear, problem-scoped.
